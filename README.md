# containers

This repository provides [container image](https://opencontainers.org/) builds of repositories that do not provide their own, or slightly adjusted upstream images.
The primary purpose is for use in [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html), as well as for installation in other container images[^container-images-install].

[^container-images-install]: The easiest way to install an application in a container image without a package manager, is to copy the binary from a separate container image that already contains the binary.

## Available Containers

| Upstream Repository         | Container Image                                           | Architecture                                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [crate-ci/typos]            | [`ghcr.io/pigeonf/containers/typos:1.31.1`][typos]        | `amd64`, `arm64` [^rust-target]                                            |
| [crate-ci/committed]        | [`ghcr.io/pigeonf/containers/committed:1.1.7`][committed] | `amd64`, `arm64` [^rust-target]                                            |
| [moby/buildkit] [^buildkit] | [`ghcr.io/pigeonf/containers/buildkit`][buildkit]         | `amd64`, `arm/v7`, `arm64`, `s390x`, `ppc64le`, `riscv64` [^buildkit-arch] |

[crate-ci/typos]: https://github.com/crate-ci/typos
[typos]: https://github.com/PigeonF/containers/pkgs/container/containers%2Ftypos
[crate-ci/committed]: https://github.com/crate-ci/committed
[committed]: https://github.com/PigeonF/containers/pkgs/container/containers%2Fcommitted
[moby/buildkit]: https://github.com/moby/buildkit
[buildkit]: https://github.com/PigeonF/containers/pkgs/container/containers%2Fbuildkit

[^rust-target]: The images are also built for `windows/arm64`, but are available under a separate tag (`<version>-ltsc`).
  See the package registry for details.

[^buildkit]: This is a copy of the [upstream buildkit container](https://hub.docker.com/r/moby/buildkit).
  The only difference is an added `EXPOSE` instruction so that the buildkit container can be used as a [GitLab CI/CD service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/services/).

[^buildkit-arch]: The same architectures as the upstream image.

## Building

To build a container you have to call `docker bake` with the name of the container.
For example, to build the `typos` container

```console
docker buildx bake typos
```

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [developer documentation](./docs/developing.md).
